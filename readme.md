## Overview

This project focuses on demonstrating the use of logistic regression to solve classification problems on datasets created using `make_classification` from `scikit-learn`. The project covers binary classification, multi-class classification, and handling imbalanced datasets. Various performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and ROC AUC curve are used to evaluate the models.

## Introduction

Logistic regression is a fundamental classification algorithm widely used in machine learning. This project demonstrates how to create and solve binary, multi-class, and imbalanced classification problems using logistic regression. Cross-validation is employed to ensure robust model evaluation, and various performance metrics are used to assess the models' effectiveness.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

- Binary Classification: Create a binary classification dataset using make_classification and train a logistic regression model on it.
- Multi-class Classification: Create a multi-class classification dataset and train a logistic regression model on it.
- Imbalanced Dataset: Create an imbalanced dataset and train a logistic regression model on it.
- Cross-Validation: Apply cross-validation to evaluate the model performance.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluate the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and ROC AUC curve.

## Datasets

The datasets are created using `make_classification` from `scikit-learn`. The function allows for the generation of synthetic datasets suitable for classification problems.

## Binary Classification
A dataset with two classes is created.
Features are generated to represent two distinct classes.


## Multi-class Classification
A dataset with more than two classes is created.
Features are generated to represent multiple classes.

## Imbalanced Dataset
A dataset with an imbalanced class distribution is created.
One class significantly outnumbers the other classes.

## Modeling
The logistic regression model is used for all classification tasks. The modeling process includes:

- Data preprocessing: Standardizing features and splitting datasets into training and testing sets.
- Model training: Fitting the logistic regression model to the training data.
- Cross-validation: Applying cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the logistic regression models is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
- Confusion Matrix: A table that describes the performance of the classification model by showing the true vs. predicted classifications.
- Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
- ROC Curve: A graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of the binary classifier.
- ROC AUC Curve: The area under the ROC curve, providing a single value to summarize the performance of the model.

## Results

The results of the logistic regression models will be presented in terms of the evaluation metrics mentioned above. Detailed analysis and visualizations will be provided to illustrate the models' performance across binary, multi-class, and imbalanced classification tasks.
